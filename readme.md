## Tools Included in this Project

The intention is to provide a basic, but comprehensive, skeleton for React projects. The tools included are:

- React (of course)
- Redux (state management)
- React Router (routing)
- Stylelint and eslint (modified AirBnB)
- Jest (testing)

All of these are currently mainstream tools for building modern JavaScript applications, however, it may be useful to discuss the rationale for the inclusion of some of these tools.

#### Redux
Redux is both a library and an architecture. It is influenced by Flux, Immutable.js and other prior work. Dan Abramov, the creator of Redux, posted a response on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32461229/why-use-redux-over-facebook-flux) about how/why Redux may be preferred over Flux. It provides valuable insight into the major benefits of Redux.
