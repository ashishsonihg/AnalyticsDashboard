# React based Analytics Dashboard


We recommend using [yarn](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1840075619545360) to manage dependencies. To begin using yarn, install globally with `npm install -g yarn`.

Then simply clone the repository and install using the `yarn` command.

```
git clone git@github.com:ashishsonihg/AnalyticsDashboard.git
cd AnalyticsDashboard
yarn
```

By default, the site is available at http://localhost:3000
```
npm run start
```
this starts both react app and json Server

JSON server is available at at http://localhost:5000

===============================================

Jest is also setup
```
npm run test
```

#### Redux
Redux is both a library and an architecture. It is influenced by Flux, Immutable.js and other prior work. Dan Abramov, the creator of Redux, posted a response on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32461229/why-use-redux-over-facebook-flux) about how/why Redux may be preferred over Flux. It provides valuable insight into the major benefits of Redux.
